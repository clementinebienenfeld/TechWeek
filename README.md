# TechWeek
This is a quick project made during the TechWeek at Dauphine University, Paris, France. 
The aim was to learn how to code a website page from scratch.

My project was to code a website that delivers a list of parisian associations given an Arrondissement and a field of interest.
I had a day and a half to code it.

I used :
- Mairie de Paris Open Data API : https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/liste_des_associations_parisiennes/information/
- HTLM, CSS and JavaScript

Hope you'll enjoy it !
